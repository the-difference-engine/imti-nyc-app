# The Difference Engine - International Montessori Training Institute

IMTI is a nonprofit organization and a training center of the Association Montessori Inter-
nationale (AMI). 

At The Difference Engine, we are providing a new web application for IMTI, built with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

The Difference Engine is a web development agency that builds websites, internal platforms, and other development projects for non-profit and charity organizations on a pro bono basis.



# name of the projects and all sub-modules and libraries (sometimes they are named different and very confusing to new users)
This is the Imti App.

# descriptions of all the project, and all sub-modules and libraries
International Montessori Training Institute accepts students who want to take courses and obtain teaching certificates in montessori teaching techniques.
Interested students can apply to take certificate-courses, as well as non-certificate workshops.

# 5-line code snippet on how its used (if it's a library)

Students interested in taking courses can visit the calendar to see which courses are being offered. Once a course is decided upon, the applicant will fill out an application and pay the application fee for the course. Once accepted to the course, the applicant will pay the tuition for the course chosen.
